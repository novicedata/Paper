> Abstract: The Grove model introduces a novel adaptive testing algorithm that decomposes boosting models into individual trees to create subgroups for item selection. By leveraging the additive structure of boosting models, Grove enables alternate-form test formulation and personalized assessment while mitigating item exposure concerns. Initial studies using cognitive, psychological, and qualification exam datasets demonstrated that several specific configurations of Grove, when provided with enough items, markedly outperform traditional decision tree-based CAT models. The model successfully replicates core adaptive testing features while enhancing efficiency and security. Future research should focus on hyperparameter optimization and validating the model across diverse test types and data volumes.
